# Bubble and Merge Sorters
This Bubble and Merge sorter project is about sorting a list of random numbers, in ascending order, requested by the Product Owner.
It works by prompting users to input the number of numbers they would like to be sorted in the array.
Users will also be prompted to choose which sorting method they would like the numbers to be arranged by.
Their choices are between Bubble and Merge sort.
Using the information provided by the users, they will be shown how their number array arranged in ascending order.
They will also be shown how long it took the method to sort the array, using the nanoTime() method.
This product is for users who want to input a certain number of numbers and see them get arranged in order, as well as how long it took.
